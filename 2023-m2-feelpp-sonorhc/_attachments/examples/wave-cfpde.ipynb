These configuration files define the mathematical models, boundary and initial conditions, parameters, domain, and other necessary information to describe the problem. This makes $\\texttt{CFPDEs}$ very flexible and adaptable to a wide range problems.\n","Our project focuses on simulating acoustic wave propagation in a 2D urban environment. Our approach involves transforming the classic second-order acoustic wave equation into a first-order system to be compatible with the $\\texttt{CFPDEs toolbox}$, which primarily handles first-order partial differential equations $\\texttt{(PDEs).}$\n","The general form of the equation is given by:\n","\n$$\n  d\\partial_t u + \\nabla.(-c\\nabla u -\\alpha u +\\gamma) + \\beta \\nabla u + u = f\n$$\n","\n","- $u$ : is the unknown quantity that we are trying to solve for.\n","- $d$ : is the diffusion coefficient.\n","- $c$ : is the convection coefficient.\n","- $\\alpha$ : is the damping coefficient..\n","- $\\beta$ : is the stress coefficient.\n","- $\\gamma$ : is the source coefficient.\n","- $a$ : is the reaction coefficient.\n","- $f$ : is the forcing term.\n","\n","The urban environment is represented in our first test by a simple square and other geometry  in a 2D plane.\n","\n","![ROOT:square mesh toolbox](ROOT:square-mesh-toolbox.png)\n","\n","The classic acoustic wave equation is given by:\n","\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial^2 p}{\\partial t^2} - c^2 \\nabla^2 p = 0\n$$\n","where $p$ is the acoustic pressure and $c$ is the speed of sound.\n","To adapt this to a first-order system, we introduce the velocity $v = \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t}$. Thus, the equation is transformed into:\n","\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} - v = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} - c^2 \\nabla^2 p = 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\implies\n\\begin{cases}\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial t} - v = 0 \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial v}{\\partial t} + \\nabla \\cdot (-c^2 \\nabla p) = 0\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n","This formulation is compatible with the $\\texttt{CFPDEs toolbox}$, which requires first-order $\\texttt{PDEs}$.\n","Comparing the wave equation with the general form of the equation, we get the following identification:\n","\n","- $u = p$ : is the acoustic pressure.\n","- $d = 1$ : is the diffusion coefficient.\n","- $c = a = \\alpha = \\beta = \\gamma =  0$\n","- $f = v$ : is the forcing term.\n","\n","\n","- $u = v$ : is the velocity.\n","- $d = 1$ : is the diffusion coefficient.\n","- $\\gamma = -c^2 \\nabla p$ : is the source coefficient.\n","- $\\alpha = \\beta = c = a = f = 0$\n","\n\n","## Impl√©mentation\n\n","The $\\texttt{JSON}$ file configures the following:\n","\n","- **Models(`cfpdes`)** : Definition of the equations (`equation1` for pressure, `equation2` for
